## Description
Cello is a floating window manager for X11.

Cello is intended to be a lightweight and customizable window manager. It uses a client, called cellist, to comunicate with the wm, using a socket that allows you to write your own softwares to talk with the wm (such as voice assistents), not depending of cellist.

### important: this project is under development, not recommended to use it as your main window manager
